## Instruction how to use?
1.	The app is has a model to recognize the images of the Coral Reef but with some specific only and here is the following in list:
a.	Bean Coral
b.	Brain Coral
c.	Branching Frogspawn Coral
d.	Bubble Coral
e.	Bulb-tentacle Sea Anemone

t.	Knob Coral
u.	Lace Coral
v.	Lacy-head Leather Coral
w.	Lettuce Coral
x.	Mushroom coral
2.	Provided Google drive link of the images that this will be the reference of the coral reefs the trained in the Teachable Machine or Tensorflow that will serve as ANN (Artificial Neural Network) that converted to a model then imported to the app that will use in offline mode. This is the heart of the app that functions the Image Recognition.
